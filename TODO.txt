Practical Rules of Data Science:


1. Before start any cleaning, you should plot the data,
plot the distribution around the standard deviation.
In addition with outlayers

2. You should analize the data, as an example with 
ANOVA and PCA.

3. Before insert null values with  mean values or another technique, try to develop the model
dropping them.

4. Plot the distribution of the points.If you dot have enough data introduce data, but carefully because, the mean
destroy the data.


5. Before use neural network, try to identify first standard methods of ml.
For example if you are performin classification try to perform clusterization.

6. If your are not satisfied with your first model, try with neural network, and compare them.

7. It is needed test your data and compare at least two models.
